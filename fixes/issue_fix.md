# Fix for: Add LICENSE file (e.g., MIT) for clear project licensing

The repository currently does not include a `LICENSE` file. Adding one will provide clarity to users and contributors about how this project can be used, shared, and modified.

**Why this matters:**

* Without an explicit license, others technically do not have permission to use, modify, or distribute the code.
* A license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL) makes it easier for developers, companies, and open-source communities to adopt and contribute confidently.
* It improves the project’s professionalism and discoverability since GitHub also highlights licensed projects more clearly.

**Suggested Solution:**

* Add a `LICENSE` file at the root of the repository.
* Recommend using a permissive license like **MIT** (widely used in open-source automation/template projects), unless you prefer another.
